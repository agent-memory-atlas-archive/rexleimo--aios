# Hermes-Inspired Capability Mapping (AIOS)

Date: 2026-04-12

This page tracks which Hermes-inspired capabilities are implemented in AIOS, what remains, and what is intentionally out of scope.

## Capability Matrix

| Hermes Capability | Hermes Reference | AIOS Mapping | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Session recall with explainability | `tools/session_search_tool.py` | `contextdb recall:sessions` + explainable scoring output | Done |
| Memory injection safety scan | `tools/memory_tool.py` | Workspace memo safety checks before prompt injection | Done |
| Subagent progress visibility | `tools/delegate_tool.py` | `team status --watch` / `hud --watch` job+tool progress + stalled signal | Done |
| Executor capability declaration | `tools/registry.py`, `toolsets.py` | Dispatch-time `executorCapabilityManifest` in report/artifacts | Done |
| Pre-mutation rollback checkpoint | `tools/checkpoint_manager.py` | Live subagent opt-in pre-mutation snapshot (`AIOS_SUBAGENT_PRE_MUTATION_SNAPSHOT=1`) + `snapshot-rollback` manifest-driven restore command + CI manifest-shape assertions in live-runtime regression tests | Done |
| Multi-platform gateway + cron | `gateway/platforms/*` | Plugin-style integration only (not core) | Deferred by design |

## Current AIOS Controls

- Live execution still requires explicit opt-in (`AIOS_EXECUTE_LIVE=1` + `AIOS_SUBAGENT_CLIENT`).
- Capability-unknown guard blocks risky live runs unless explicitly overridden.
- Pre-mutation snapshots are opt-in and currently scoped to editable phase owned paths in live subagent runtime.
- Snapshot rollback is now available via `node scripts/aios.mjs snapshot-rollback --session <session_id>` (or `--manifest <path>`).
- Live-runtime regression now includes explicit snapshot manifest shape assertions (schema/version/paths/target types/restore hint coherence).
- Incident recovery workflow and command examples are documented in `docs/reference/snapshot-incident-recovery.md`.

## Next Optional Improvements

No open Hermes-inspired baseline follow-ups in this cycle.
